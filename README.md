# RNN and LSTM from Scratch

This project implements Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures from scratch using PyTorch trained on the "Human Numbers" dataset from fastai. It's a personal learning project created and trained in a Jupyter Notebook environment (originally on Kaggle).

## Features

* Custom RNN and LSTM model architectures
* Trained on fastai's "Human Numbers" dataset
* Custom dropout, AR, and TAR regularizers

## Notes

This is a personal educational endeavor. The primary purpose is experimentation and learning.
